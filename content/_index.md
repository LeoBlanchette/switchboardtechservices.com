Switchboard Tech Services is a small mobile service in downtown Kirksville that fixes what others replace.  

I handle everyday computer issues, restore old hardware, and build or maintain simple websites for locals and small businesses.  

No contracts, no gimmicks -- just direct repair and practical help within a couple miles of the courthouse.  
If it plugs in, powers on, or connects to the internet, thereâ€™s a good chance I can make it work again.
