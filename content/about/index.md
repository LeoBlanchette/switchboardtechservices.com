# About Switchboard Tech Services

## Who We Are
Switchboard Tech Services, LLC is a **family-run business in Kirksville**.  
We were founded to meet the steady demand for on-site tech help in Kirksville — the kind of personal support that’s harder to find in today’s age of automation and corporate call centers.

Our goal is simple:  
**practical, person-to-person fixes for everyday technology problems.**

### The Name 
"**The Switchboard**" is a name inspired from old tech and a location in the game Fallout 4.

## What We Do Differently
### Local and Person-Focused
- Based near the Adair County Courthouse.  
- Meetings and drop-offs arranged at the courthouse — a neutral, trusted spot.  
- Repairs are done in our own workshop, not shipped away.  

### Filling Local Gaps
Kirksville businesses and residents rely heavily on tech — card readers, Wi-Fi, printers, laptops, smart devices — but often lack in-house IT.  
Switchboard was created to:
- Keep local shops running when POS or Wi-Fi fails.  
- Help retirees and students with practical, plain-English support.  
- Repair or repurpose electronics that others won’t touch.  

### Help, Not Compete
We know established providers like Sprocket Technologies and Anderson Computer Consultants cover much of the mainstream IT and device repair. Switchboard fills the **underserved space**:
- After-hours and on-site service.  
- Linux systems and conversions.  
- Oddball electronics and custom devices.  
- Patient tutoring and one-on-one help.

## Why It Matters
Technology should **work for the people who use it**.  
That means:
- Clear explanations, not jargon.  
- Honest rates and simple terms.  
- Repairs and conversions that extend the life of equipment instead of pushing replacement.  

Switchboard Tech Services exists to keep everyday tools running — from laptops and Wi-Fi to POS systems and small electronics — in a way that’s local, dependable, and personal.
