# How I Host Your Website in Kirksville

_By Switchboard Tech Services -- Kirksville, Missouri_

When I build a website for you, I use the same stack I trust for my own business.  
The secret is not a fancy platform or expensive subscription -- it is a clean, efficient combination of three tools that work perfectly together.

**Porkbun + Opalstack + HTML Website = a beautiful trio for classy and low cost modern websites.**

## Part I. The Trio That Makes It Work

### Porkbun: Honest and Affordable Domains

[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) is one of the best domain registrars available today. They are simple, transparent, and genuinely customer-friendly.  
There are no upsells, hidden add-ons, or confusing dashboards -- just clear pricing and reliable service.

Typical domain prices:

| Domain Type | Example | Annual Cost (approx.) |
|--------------|----------|----------------------:|
| Standard .com | example.com | $10 |
| Alternative .net | example.net | $12 |
| Vanity .co or .store | example.store | $20 to $40 |

I pass this cost directly to Porkbun. You pay them for the registration; I do not add any markup.

### Opalstack: Professional Hosting Without the Bloat

[Opalstack](https://www.opalstack.com) is a modern, developer-grade hosting provider that focuses on reliability and flexibility.  
It is the spiritual successor to Webfaction -- fast, clean, and powerful without the marketing noise.

Your site is hosted on professional-grade servers that support everything from static HTML to Python and email hosting.  
You get the same reliability large companies depend on, but at a fraction of the price.

Unlike budget hosts that cram thousands of sites onto one slow server, Opalstack keeps performance consistent.  
No ads, no hidden limits, and no data harvesting.

### HTML Websites: The Art and Science of Simplicity

(see [posts/html-websites-future](posts/html-websites-future))

I have built sites using PHP, Python, and even full content management systems like WordPress and Django.  
They can be powerful, but they are also heavier, slower, and more complex to maintain.  
A pure HTML site, built with a modern static generator like Hugo, is faster, leaner, and more secure.

**Why HTML is better for most small businesses:**

| Feature | HTML Site | WordPress or Dynamic Site |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|
| Speed | Lightning fast -- loads instantly | Often slow due to scripts and databases |
| Security | No database or login to hack | Constant patching and plugin updates |
| Maintenance | Simple and nearly zero upkeep | Regular maintenance required |
| Longevity | Works for decades with minimal changes | Prone to software rot or service obsolescence |

For most businesses, HTML represents the perfection of web design as a craft -- minimal moving parts, maximum reliability.  
If you ever need a more complex dynamic setup, I also handle those on a **different pricing tier**, decided case by case.

You will choose from [these hugo templates https://themes.gohugo.io/](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and I will build your desired site using the template you choose.

## Part II. What You Actually Pay For

Transparency matters. Here is exactly how the pricing breaks down.

| Service | Description | Cost |
|----------|--------------|------:|
| **Setup Fee (me)** | Initial build, configuration, and site launch | **$40 one-time** |
| **Domain Registration** | Paid directly to Porkbun, typically for a .com or vanity domain | **~$10-$60 per year** |
| **Hosting Fee** | Fast Opalstack hosting with light maintenance | **$15 per month** |

Customers are encouraged to include text and images they want featured.  
I will handle formatting, optimization, and publication.  
A few small updates per week are included, provided they are clearly written and ready to post.

Thus here is our full website service breakdown:

## Part III. Comparing to the Big "Cheap" Builders

Here is what most people discover after trying the big website builders.

| Platform | Base Price | Realistic Monthly Cost After Upsells | Yearly Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------:|-------------:|-------|
| Wix | $17 | ~$30 | ~$360 | Domain and SSL sold separately after first year |
| Squarespace | $23 | ~$33 | ~$396 | Extra fees for email or analytics |
| GoDaddy Website Builder | $10 | ~$25 | ~$300 | Heavy upsells and limited customization |
| WordPress.com | $10 | ~$28 | ~$336 | Requires plugins or paid theme for real features |
| **Switchboard Tech Services** | -- | **$15** | **$180 per year + ~$10 domain** | Transparent, local, and personal |

**Result:**  
Most builder plans end up costing $300â€“$500 per year after realistic fees.  
Your site with me averages **around $230 for the first year** (including setup and domain), then only **about $190 per year after that.**

And unlike those platforms, **you own your site outright.**  
No lock-ins, no hidden subscriptions, and no upsells.

## Part IV. The Local, Honest Way to Be Online

When I build your site, you get something that is both elegant and durable.  
It loads fast, it looks professional, and it costs less than what the big companies charge for templates and advertising banners.
