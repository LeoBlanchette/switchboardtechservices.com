Here’s a friendly breakdown of Kirksville’s available internet providers—what they offer, where they shine, and how to get in touch. No sales pitches. Just a clean list from someone who’s crawled roofs, braved customer service lines, and set up more modems than is healthy.

## Cable & Fiber Providers

### Sparklight (Cable One)

- **Website:** [sparklight.com](https://www.sparklight.com)
- **Phone:** (660) 665-7066
- **Type:** Cable (DOCSIS 3.1) – Up to 1 Gbps

Kirksville’s cable mainstay. Fast, widely available, and usually reliable—but be sure to keep an eye on billing changes after the first year. Great for households needing lots of bandwidth.

---

### Socket Telecom

- **Website:** [socket.net](https://www.socket.net)
- **Phone:** 1‑800‑762‑5383
- **Type:** Fiber (where available) – Up to 1 Gbps symmetric

If your block has it, you’re in luck. Socket offers stable, symmetrical gigabit internet with no contracts and friendly support. One of the most “set-it-and-forget-it” ISPs around here.

---

### NEMR Telecom

- **Website:** [nemr.net](https://nemr.net)
- **Phone:** (660) 874-4111
- **Type:** Fiber (FTTH)

Local fiber cooperative reaching parts of north and east Kirksville. Outstanding customer reputation. If NEMR serves your area, it’s a serious contender for the best connection in town.

---

## DSL & Legacy Wireline Options

### Brightspeed (formerly CenturyLink)

- **Website:** [brightspeed.com](https://www.brightspeed.com)
- **Phone:** 1‑833‑692‑7773
- **Type:** DSL (via phone line) – Up to 40 Mbps

The fallback when newer infrastructure isn’t an option. Affordable and often available even out in the sticks. Best for light browsing and email. Not built for heavy-duty streaming or Zooming.

---

### EarthLink

- **Website:** [earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net)
- **Phone:** 1‑866‑383‑3080
- **Type:** Fiber or DSL (depends on location)

EarthLink leases connections from other ISPs. Sometimes that means you’re getting Brightspeed in disguise. That said, EarthLink fans like the customer service and lack of sneaky fees.

## Fixed Wireless Providers

### Mark Twain Communications

- **Website:** [marktwain.net](https://marktwain.net)
- **Phone:** (660) 423-5211
- **Type:** Fixed Wireless (LTE/5G mmWave)

$55/month. No contracts. No data caps. Local team. If your property gets a good line of sight to their towers, this is a modern wireless option that outperforms old DSL any day.

---

## Cellular Home Internet (5G/LTE)

### T-Mobile 5G Home Internet

- **Website:** [t-mobile.com/home-internet](https://www.t-mobile.com/home-internet)
- **Phone:** 1‑844‑839‑5057
- **Type:** 5G Home Gateway

If you’ve got decent cell bars, T-Mobile’s plug-and-play home router could get you 100–300 Mbps. Unlimited data, no extra fees. Performance may vary with signal strength and tower traffic.

---

### Verizon 5G Home Internet

- **Website:** [verizon.com/5g/home](https://www.verizon.com/5g/home/)
- **Phone:** 1‑800‑922‑0204
- **Type:** 5G or 4G LTE

Similar to T-Mobile, with better speeds **if** you’re under their ultra-wideband coverage. Great when it works—but check your address first. Coverage can be spotty just outside town.

---

### UScellular Home Internet

- **Website:** [uscellular.com/home-internet](https://www.uscellular.com/home-internet)
- **Phone:** (660) 341-8300
- **Type:** 4G/5G Cellular Wireless

More rural-friendly. If you're already a UScellular mobile customer, this can be a cost-effective way to stay connected, especially where wired options don’t reach.

---

## Satellite Providers (Including Starlink)

### Starlink (SpaceX)

- **Website:** [starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com)
- **Phone:** Online only
- **Type:** Low-Earth Orbit Satellite – ~50–200 Mbps

Finally, a satellite service that behaves more like real broadband. Low latency, no data caps, and decent speeds—even for video calls. Big up-front cost, but a huge upgrade for rural homes.

---

### HughesNet

- **Website:** [hughesnet.com](https://www.hughesnet.com)
- **Phone:** 1‑844‑202‑7220
- **Type:** Satellite (Geo) – 25–100 Mbps

The “it’ll do in a pinch” option. Works almost anywhere. Great for email and light browsing—not so much for video or gaming. Data caps and high latency make it a backup-tier solution.

---

### Viasat (Exede)

- **Website:** [viasat.com/internet](https://www.viasat.com/internet/)
- **Phone:** 1‑844‑702‑3199
- **Type:** Satellite (Geo) – Up to 150 Mbps

Like HughesNet but with higher data allowances. Solid fallback when you’re way off the grid. Watch the fine print for post-promo pricing.

---

## Enterprise Fiber for Businesses

### Bluebird Network

- **Website:** [bluebirdnetwork.com](https://bluebirdnetwork.com)
- **Phone:** 1‑855‑BLUEBIRD (1-855-258-3247)
- **Type:** Enterprise-grade Fiber

If you're running a business and need guaranteed uptime, Bluebird is your fiber partner. High-speed, dedicated circuits for serious bandwidth needs. Not for casual users.

## Summary: Which ISP Should You Choose?

There’s no single “best” provider in Kirksville—it depends on your location, usage needs, and budget. A few quick tips:

- **In town?** Sparklight or Socket.
- **Just outside city limits?** Try Mark Twain or NEMR.
- **Remote or rural?** T-Mobile, Starlink, or even UScellular might save the day.
- **Last resort?** HughesNet or Viasat will get you online.
- **Running a business?** Call Bluebird.

Always check availability by address. Some providers even offer free speed tests before signup. When in doubt, ask neighbors or call around—local word-of-mouth is golden.

Stay connected out there.
