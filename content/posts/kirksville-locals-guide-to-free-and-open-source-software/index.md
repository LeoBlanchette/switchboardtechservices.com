# The Kirksville Local’s Guide to Free and Open-Source Software
_By Switchboard Tech Services -- Kirksville, Missouri_

Every computer in Kirksville should come with a little less rent and a little more ownership.  
Free and open-source software (FOSS) is exactly that idea made practical: you get powerful, secure tools built by communities, not corporations, and you pay nothing except attention.

This guide walks through **two practical paths** -- one for Windows users who want to stop paying for subscriptions, and one for Linux users who already jumped the fence.

---

## Part 1: Windows-Centric Tools

Open-source software runs great on Windows. You can replace nearly every paid program with a free alternative that is often faster and safer.  

### Web Browsing: Privacy Without Popups
- **Firefox** ([https://www.mozilla.org/firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox))  
  The classic open browser. Privacy-first, customizable, and backed by a nonprofit.  
- **Brave** ([https://brave.com](https://brave.com))  
  Built on Chromium, but blocks ads and trackers out of the box. It is Chrome without the snooping.

### Office and Documents
- **LibreOffice** ([https://www.libreoffice.org](https://www.libreoffice.org))  
  Fully replaces Microsoft Office. You can open and save Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files natively.  
- **OnlyOffice** ([https://www.onlyoffice.com](https://www.onlyoffice.com))  
  A clean, modern interface that feels closer to Microsoft 365. Great for collaboration.

### Image and Design Tools
- **GIMP** ([https://www.gimp.org](https://www.gimp.org))  
  A capable Photoshop replacement for photo editing, illustration, and graphic work.  
- **Inkscape** ([https://inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org))  
  Vector design software similar to Adobe Illustrator. Excellent for logo design and sign layouts.  
- **Krita** ([https://krita.org](https://krita.org))  
  Built for digital painters and illustrators. Artists love it for tablet workflow and brush realism.

### Video and Audio
- **Shotcut** ([https://shotcut.org](https://shotcut.org))  
  Straightforward video editor with support for all common formats.  
- **Audacity** ([https://www.audacityteam.org](https://www.audacityteam.org))  
  The classic open audio editor. Ideal for podcasts, music trimming, or cleaning up recordings.

### System Utilities and Maintenance
- **BleachBit** ([https://www.bleachbit.org](https://www.bleachbit.org))  
  Cleans temporary files and caches better than most commercial "PC cleaner" apps.  
- **7-Zip** ([https://www.7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org))  
  Essential file compression tool that handles everything from ZIP to ISO.  
- **VLC Media Player** ([https://www.videolan.org/vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc))  
  The ultimate "plays anything" media player. Handles every format without downloading extra codecs.

### Security and Privacy
- **KeePassXC** ([https://keepassxc.org](https://keepassxc.org))  
  A password manager that keeps your credentials in an encrypted file you control.  
- **qBittorrent** ([https://www.qbittorrent.org](https://www.qbittorrent.org))  
  For legal torrent downloads (Linux ISOs, open data, etc.). No ads, no spyware.  
- **ProtonVPN** ([https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com))  
  Free tier available, open-source client, and strong privacy track record.

## Part 2: Linux-Centric Tools

Linux users already live in the open-source world. But if you are new to it, think of Linux as **Windows that respects you** -- fast, quiet, no forced updates or ads in the start menu.

Most of the tools above run on Linux too, but here are a few that shine brightest in that environment.

### Everyday Linux Applications
- **LibreOffice** (again, yes) comes preinstalled on most distributions.  
- **Firefox** or **Brave** work just as well here as on Windows.  
- **Thunderbird** ([https://www.thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net))  
  Reliable email client with calendar integration, offline storage, and encryption support.

### Terminal and File Tools
- **Midnight Commander** ([https://midnight-commander.org](https://midnight-commander.org))  
  Old-school dual-panel file manager that still beats most GUIs for speed.  
- **rsync** ([https://rsync.samba.org](https://rsync.samba.org))  
  Command-line synchronization tool -- perfect for local backups or cloning folders.  
- **Timeshift** ([https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift))  
  Makes snapshot backups of your system. If something breaks, roll it back like a time machine.

### Creative Tools
- **Darktable** ([https://www.darktable.org](https://www.darktable.org))  
  Non-destructive photo editor for RAW image workflows, like Adobe Lightroom.  
- **Blender** ([https://www.blender.org](https://www.blender.org))  
  Full 3D creation suite for modeling, animation, and rendering. Used professionally worldwide.  
- **Kdenlive** ([https://kdenlive.org](https://kdenlive.org))  
  Nonlinear video editor with advanced features -- and it rarely crashes.  

### System Monitoring and Utilities
- **htop** ([https://htop.dev](https://htop.dev))  
  Task Manager done right. Clean, colorful, and informative.  
- **GParted** ([https://gparted.org](https://gparted.org))  
  Safely partitions drives. Ideal for dual-boot setups and troubleshooting.  
- **Synaptic Package Manager**  
  A graphical tool for browsing and managing installed software packages.

## Why This Matters

Kirksville’s tech scene thrives on independence. Every time you replace a subscription or cloud account with a reliable open-source tool, you keep a little more control over your computer and your wallet.  
You also make local repair easier: open systems are fixable systems.

Most open-source software is made by small, passionate teams. When you use their work, you are joining a global circle of people who believe technology should serve everyone -- not just shareholders.

## The Honest Ending

If you like this approach, you might as well take the next step. Most people who get serious about open-source software eventually realize that the foundation of it all -- Linux -- can replace Windows entirely.

Unless you are a gamer or a full-time graphic designer (and even then, Linux is catching up fast), there is no reason not to switch.

Start with something friendly like **[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)** or **[Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)**.  
Once you see how fast your system boots and how little it nags you, you will not look back.
