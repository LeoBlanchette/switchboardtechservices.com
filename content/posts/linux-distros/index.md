## Ubuntu

![Ubuntu Linux](images/ubuntu.webp)

### Why People Choose It
Ubuntu is the poster child for user-friendly Linux. With 6+ million active users and near-total dominance in the cloud, it’s the default choice for many. LTS (Long-Term Support) versions get 5+ years of updates and are widely trusted by pros and beginners alike.

### Key Traits
- **Ease of Use:** Excellent. Friendly installer, vast tutorials, smooth GUI.
- **Update Cadence:** Every 6 months (LTS every 2 years). Balanced pace.
- **Hardware Support:** Superb. Newest kernels and proprietary drivers.
- **Enterprise/Cloud Use:** Dominant on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
- **Security:** Fast patch delivery. AppArmor enabled. Canonical-backed.
- **Governance:** Canonical-led but with community involvement.

### Best For
New users, developers, sysadmins, anyone needing a stable, predictable OS with modern support.

## Fedora

### Why People Choose It
Fedora is fast, fresh, and open. It's where Red Hat and CentOS get their future tech. If you want to be on the cutting edge—but not fall off it—Fedora is ideal.

### Key Traits
- **Ease of Use:** Moderate. GNOME interface, modern but opinionated.
- **Update Cadence:** Every 6 months. Short 13-month support cycle.
- **Hardware Support:** Great for new gear. Not for 32-bit-only systems.
- **Enterprise/Cloud Use:** Indirectly through RHEL.
- **Security:** SELinux enabled by default. Quick to patch.
- **Governance:** Community-led with Red Hat sponsorship.

### Best For
Developers, testers, Linux tinkerers, and those who want Red Hat roots without the enterprise wallet.

## Debian

![Debian Linux](images/debian.webp)

### Why People Choose It
Debian is rock-solid. It powers much of the internet and is the upstream for Ubuntu and Mint. If your motto is "I don’t want surprises," Debian delivers.

### Key Traits
- **Ease of Use:** Moderate to tough. Installer is plain but powerful.
- **Update Cadence:** Very slow. Stable releases every 2–3 years.
- **Hardware Support:** Legendary. Runs on everything—even 1990s hardware.
- **Enterprise/Cloud Use:** Widespread on budget-conscious infrastructure.
- **Security:** Transparent and thorough. Public security tracker.
- **Governance:** 100% community-run, democratic, decentralized.

### Best For
Admins, infrastructure architects, and people who value stability over flair.

## openSUSE (Leap and Tumbleweed)

![openSUSE Linux](images/opensuse.webp)

### Why People Choose It
openSUSE gives you choices. Leap is the polished, slow-and-steady version aligned with SUSE Enterprise. Tumbleweed is a rolling release with surprising stability.

### Key Traits
- **Ease of Use:** YaST makes configuration easy. Good desktop polish.
- **Update Cadence:** Leap = yearly minor releases. Tumbleweed = constant.
- **Hardware Support:** Broad. Backported kernels help newer CPUs.
- **Enterprise/Cloud Use:** Strong via SUSE; Leap feeds into SLES.
- **Security:** Strong testing via openQA. Snapper for rollback.
- **Governance:** Board-elected, SUSE-supported.

### Best For
Sysadmins, testers, and tinkerers who want a clean UI and solid engineering.

---

## Linux Mint

![Linux Mint](images/linux-mint.png)

### Why People Choose It
Linux Mint is Ubuntu’s calm, cinnamon-scented cousin. It’s the most beginner-friendly Linux desktop for people who just want stuff to work without the weirdness.

### Key Traits
- **Ease of Use:** Excellent. Cinnamon feels like Windows.
- **Update Cadence:** Slow. Based on Ubuntu LTS (2-year rhythm).
- **Hardware Support:** Solid. Includes codecs, printers, and Wi-Fi out of the box.
- **Enterprise/Cloud Use:** Minimal to none.
- **Security:** Inherits Ubuntu’s. Conservative update manager.
- **Governance:** Led by a small team, community influenced.

### Best For
Windows refugees, casual users, grandparents, and people who want to skip the nerdy stuff.

## Still Not Sure? Ask Yourself:
- Do I want maximum stability with minimal surprises? → **Debian**
- Do I want a desktop that feels like Windows? → **Mint**
- Do I want the safest bet for general use? → **Ubuntu**
- Do I want cutting-edge tech and don’t mind a bit of risk? → **Fedora**
- Do I want something a little different, but still solid? → **openSUSE**

For most Switchboard customers, Ubuntu or Mint is a fantastic starting point. You can always graduate to something deeper later.
