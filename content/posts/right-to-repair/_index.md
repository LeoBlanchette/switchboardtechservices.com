# Right to Repair in Missouri

In Missouri, the Right to Repair movement is gaining traction, but broad state laws have not yet passed. The idea is simple: if you own a device, you should be able to repair it without paying for permission.

Groups like **Repair.org** lead the national effort. They push for fair access to diagnostic tools, service manuals, and parts so that independent repair shops and everyday owners can keep their equipment running.

Several Missouri bills have been proposed, such as **HB 975** and **SB 1472**, both aiming to give farmers, technicians, and consumers equal access to repair information. None have yet become law.

For towns like Kirksville, this is more than politics. Locked-down tech means fewer local repairs, more waste, and less money staying in the community. The right to repair is about restoring that balance â€” your device, your rules.
