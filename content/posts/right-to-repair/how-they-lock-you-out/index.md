# How Manufacturers Lock You Out (and How We Get You Back In)

_By Switchboard Tech Services — Kirksville, Missouri_

Series: [Right to Repair](posts/right-to-repair/)

Modern devices are sleek, powerful, and smarter than ever. They are also locked down tighter than a safe. Every year, manufacturers build more barriers that stop regular people from fixing their own gear. In small towns like Kirksville, those barriers turn simple fixes into expensive replacements.

The good news? Locks can be opened.

## The Invisible Locks

Most people do not realize how many ways companies control repair. Here are a few of the biggest offenders:

**Firmware locks**  
Code that refuses to accept non-authorized parts. Swap a battery or a screen, and the device will complain or stop working entirely.

**Parts pairing**  
Each replacement part must be digitally approved by the manufacturer. If it is not, your phone or laptop may disable features or refuse to boot.

**Diagnostic restrictions**  
Manufacturers often keep diagnostic software private, meaning only "authorized" shops can access repair codes or reset tools.

**Proprietary screws and adhesives**  
Even the hardware itself can be designed to resist repair. Custom screws, glued batteries, and sealed cases mean you need special tools just to get inside.

It adds up to the same result: fewer repairs, more replacements, and less local control.

## Why They Do It

These locks are not accidents. They serve one purpose — profit.

When companies control repair, they control your spending. You must return to their service centers, pay their rates, and live on their schedule. They also use software locks to track data, control updates, and shorten a product’s life cycle.

They call it safety and consistency. We call it ownership denial.

## Why It Hurts Kirksville and Rural Missouri

For big cities, a locked device is a mild inconvenience. For small towns like Kirksville, it is a real problem. There are no corporate repair centers nearby, and shipping costs for something small can eat half a paycheck.

That means broken laptops and tractors sitting idle, waiting on permission from a company hundreds of miles away.

Local repair shops — like ours — are ready and capable, but we are often locked out by design. When those barriers come down, everyone wins: faster repairs, lower costs, and money that stays right here in Missouri.

## How We Get You Back In

At **Switchboard Tech Services**, we believe every customer deserves control over their own tools. We work within the law, but we push the limits of what is possible. Our approach is simple:

- Use open-source tools and diagnostics instead of vendor-locked software  
- Repair and refurbish hardware with Linux or other unlocked systems  
- Rebuild components from the ground up when parts are unavailable  
- Teach customers basic maintenance and repair literacy

Every unlocked laptop, every revived hard drive, is a small act of independence.

## The Bigger Picture

The fight is larger than Kirksville. Groups like [Repair.org](https://www.repair.org) are pressuring lawmakers to pass fair repair laws. Missouri has seen bills introduced, but none have passed yet. Farmers, technicians, and small-town repair shops are leading the way.

The more people understand how these locks work, the sooner they can be broken for good.
