# Repairability Scores: How to Read the Fine Print Before You Buy

_By Switchboard Tech Services — Kirksville, Missouri_

Series: [Right to Repair](posts/right-to-repair/)

Not all devices are created equal. Some are built to last. Others are built to make you buy the next model sooner. That difference often shows up in a quiet little metric called the **repairability score**.

It is a number that tells you how fixable a product is — and it can save you a lot of money and frustration down the road.

## What Is a Repairability Score

A repairability score rates how easy it is to open, repair, and replace parts in a device. Higher numbers mean better repair access and longer product life.

In some countries, such as France and the European Union, manufacturers must publish these scores by law. In the United States, it is still mostly voluntary, though the **[Right to Repair](https://missouri.repair.org/)** movement is pushing to make it standard everywhere.

Think of it like a nutrition label for your electronics — it tells you what you are really buying.

## What the Numbers Mean

Scores usually range from **1 to 10**, but the meaning depends on how honest the manufacturer is being. Here is the general breakdown:

- **9 to 10**: Easy to open, standard screws, replacement parts available. A repair shop in Kirksville can handle it quickly.  
- **6 to 8**: Fixable but may require special tools or some disassembly. Still worth buying if you care about longevity.  
- **3 to 5**: Sealed cases, glued batteries, limited part access. Repairs are possible but difficult or expensive.  
- **1 to 2**: Disposable tech. Replacement is cheaper than repair. These devices are designed to die young.  

When possible, choose products with scores of 6 or higher. You will get more life and fewer headaches.

## Why It Matters in Missouri

In rural areas like **Kirksville**, access to repair services is already limited. If your phone or laptop needs to be mailed off for corporate service, that can take weeks. Buying gear that is easier to repair locally keeps your downtime low and your dollars close to home.

At **Switchboard Tech Services**, we see this every week. Two laptops come in with the same problem — one with a modular battery, the other glued shut. One is fixed in an hour. The other becomes e-waste. The difference is not luck. It is design.

## How to Check Before You Buy

You do not need to be a technician to make smarter choices. Just do a little research before handing over your card.

1. **Search for your device....**  
   Many are listed on [www.ifixit.com/](https://www.ifixit.com/) and independent databases.  

2. **Look for teardowns.**  
   Websites like iFixit rate products on ease of disassembly and part availability.  

3. **Ask about parts.**  
   When buying in person, ask if replacement screens, batteries, or fans are available separately.  

4. **Buy from brands that support repair.**  
   Framework, Fairphone, and even some Dell and Lenovo models have strong repair records.  

A few minutes of research can save lots of frustration.

## The Hidden Side of Sustainability

Repairability is more than convenience — it is sustainability. Every time we extend a product’s life, we keep one more device out of the landfill. That is good for the planet and for the local economy.

In a small town, that means something. Every repair teaches a skill, saves a customer, and keeps money circulating in Kirksville instead of shipping it off to California or overseas.

## Closing Thoughts

Every device you buy is a vote for the kind of tech future you want. Choose products that respect your right to repair and your right to own what you paid for.

If you are in **Kirksville or Northeast Missouri**, we can help you pick or repair devices that score high on fixability. Bring your next purchase by the shop — we will tell you if it is a keeper or a trap.
