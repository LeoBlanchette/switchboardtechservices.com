# The Right to Repair in Rural America: Why It Matters to Kirksville

Series: [Right to Repair](posts/right-to-repair/)

People around here fix things. It is just what we do. From tractors to toasters, Kirksville has always been the kind of place where you tighten the bolt instead of throwing it away. But modern technology has made that harder. Laptops sealed shut. Phones glued together. Printers that refuse to work with third-party ink. **Somewhere along the way, we stopped being owners and started being renters of the things we buy.**

That is where the right to repair comes in.

## When Devices Say No

Many companies today build walls around their products. They use locked firmware, special screws, and even software that blocks third-party repairs. Apple and John Deere are the big names, but the pattern runs through every industry. You can not fix your phone because the part is serialized. You can not service your tractor because the diagnostic tools are locked behind a corporate paywall.

In cities, you might just drive to the nearest "authorized" repair center. In Kirksville, that often means boxing it up, shipping it out, and waiting weeks. That is time lost and money leaving the community. A simple repair that could have been done in a local shop turns into a $500 replacement.

## The Local Cost

Closed repair systems hit rural areas the hardest. Every time a device fails and has to be replaced instead of repaired, local dollars drain outward. That means fewer jobs, less skill sharing, and more dependency on distant companies.

At **Switchboard Tech Services**, we believe those skills belong here. We fix devices, but we also show people how. We replace batteries, install Linux on old laptops, and bring machines back to life. Every revived computer is one less piece of e-waste and one more dollar that stays in Kirksville.

## Repair as Civic Duty

Repairing something you own should not feel like rebellion. It should feel like responsibility. Every screw turned is an act of autonomy. Every repaired phone, a small vote for sustainability. Our grandparents fixed what they had because they had to. We should do it because it is the smarter way to live.

Repair is not just about saving money. It is about preserving the independence that small towns like ours were built on. When you can fix your own gear, you do not have to ask permission to live.

## Missouri and the Bigger Picture

Across the country, **[Right to Repair](https://missouri.repair.org/)** laws are gaining momentum. Some states have passed them. Others are debating. Missouri is watching closely, and every voice matters. Farmers have already led the charge, demanding access to the software that runs their tractors. Tech repair is the next frontier.

Europe has already started requiring repairability scores on electronics. The United States will follow, and it will be the small towns that remind lawmakers why it matters. This is not just about gadgets. It is about sovereignty.

## What You Can Do

Start small. Bring your broken devices to a local repair shop. Ask how it works. Learn to open a case safely, clean a fan, or replace a hard drive. Support the businesses that make repair possible. When you shop for new devices, look up the repairability score before buying.

And talk about it. The more we discuss the right to repair, the harder it becomes for corporations to ignore it. Repair starts in the garage, not in Congress.

## The Future is Fixable

Kirksville has always known how to make do. That same spirit can lead the way in a world of locked-down gadgets. The right to repair is about control, community, and creativity. It is about keeping technology in human hands instead of corporate ones.

Your device. Your rules.
