# How to Speed Up Your Old Laptop (Kirksville Edition)

_By Switchboard Tech Services -- Kirksville, Missouri_

If your laptop feels like it is moving through molasses, you are not alone. Many machines that seem "too old" to use can actually be revived with a few simple tweaks and upgrades. The goal here is not to turn your ten-year-old Dell into a gaming rig -- it is to make it fast enough for web browsing, writing, and day-to-day life again.

## 1. Clean up the startup clutter

Every program that loads when your laptop starts slows things down a little. Over the years, these pile up.

On Windows:
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.
- Click the **Startup** tab.
- Disable anything you do not use every day.

On Linux:
- Check your startup applications in **Settings > Startup** and toggle off extras.

Also, uninstall anything you no longer use. Free disk space helps everything else breathe easier.

## 2. Swap the hard drive for an SSD (and why it matters)

If your laptop still has a mechanical hard drive, it is the biggest reason it feels slow. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is the single best upgrade you can make. 

SSDs have no moving parts and access data almost instantly. Boot times drop from minutes to seconds, and everything from opening apps to saving files becomes smoother. 

Good news: most older laptops accept 2.5" SATA SSDs, and you can clone your old drive or reinstall the system cleanly.

This one change often makes people say, "I cannot believe this is the same laptop."

## 3. Add memory if you can

Many laptops shipped with 4 GB of RAM, which is not enough for modern browsers or multitasking. If your system allows it, bumping to 8 GB or even 16 GB can keep it from hitting the swap file constantly.

Before buying anything, check:
- How many RAM slots your laptop has
- The supported type (DDR3, DDR4, etc.)
- The maximum capacity

If you bring it to a shop, we can check this for you in minutes.

## 4. Install a lightweight Linux system

If your system still drags after upgrades, consider a lighter operating system. (Honestly, this should be a priority). A clean Linux installation can make a ten-year-old laptop feel brand new. 

Options like **Linux Mint XFCE** or **Zorin OS Lite** work well on older hardware. They include web browsers, office apps, and software centers for easy installs.

## 5. Keep it cool -- literally

Overheating makes laptops throttle performance to avoid damage. Dust builds up inside vents, clogging the fan and trapping heat.

You can:
- Blow compressed air through the vents
- Use a soft brush to clean fan grilles
- Avoid blocking vents with blankets or laps

A laptop that runs cool runs faster and lasts longer.

## 6. When to call in help -- and why local beats mailing it away

If you have done the basics and your system still crawls, local technicians can diagnose deeper issues like failing drives, bad RAM, or outdated firmware. 

Mail-in repair services may look cheap, but they often charge extra fees and take weeks. Working with someone in Kirksville means faster turnaround and real accountability.

At Switchboard Tech Services, we routinely revive machines most people would have thrown away. Many end up faster than when they were new.
