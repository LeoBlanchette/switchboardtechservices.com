A few suspects:

- Adware extensions installed quietly; review and remove unknown add-ons.
- Notification spam from sites allowed earlier; revoke permissions.
- DNS hijack or proxy set by a program; reset network settings.
- Bundled installers adding "helpers"; uninstall suspicious apps.
- Old profiles syncing the problem back in.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Extension hijack (most common)**  
  A single rogue extension can inject scripts or open tabs on a timer. Vet anything you don’t recognize. If symptoms started “after that free PDF tool,” start there. For a local case study: [/posts/kirksville-virus-that-wasnt/](/posts/kirksville-virus-that-wasnt/)

- **Web push notifications (not pop‑ups)**  
  If you clicked “Allow notifications,” sites can open tabs and toasts even when the page is closed. Turning off site notifications often stops the phantom tabs. Background: [Web push](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Push_API)

- **Proxy/DNS meddling**  
  Adware sometimes sets a **proxy** or swaps your **DNS** to ad‑heavy resolvers. That can redirect searches and spawn tabs. Resetting the network stack and DNS usually clears it.

- **Bundled installers / “helper” apps**  
  Toolbars and “updaters” sneak in with freeware bundles. Removing the program *and* its scheduled task is key. General tune‑up context: [/posts/speed-up-old-laptop/](/posts/speed-up-old-laptop/)

- **Profile sync re‑infecting**  
  Chrome/Edge/Firefox sync can re‑add bad extensions and settings from another device. Sometimes you must sign out and resync *after* cleanup.

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **Audit extensions (all browsers)**  
   - Disable everything **non‑essential**. Re‑enable one by one while testing.  
   - Chrome/Edge: `chrome://extensions` / `edge://extensions` → toggle off or **Remove**.  
   - Firefox: `about:addons`.  
   - If the bad tab stops opening, you found the culprit.

2. **Nuke notification spam**  
   - Chrome/Edge: `chrome://settings/content/notifications` / `edge://settings/content/notifications` → **Block** offenders; clear **Allowed** list.  
   - Firefox: *Settings → Privacy & Security → Permissions → Notifications → Settings…*

3. **Check startup pages and shortcuts**  
   - Chrome/Edge: *On startup* → set to **Open the New Tab page**. Remove unknown URLs.  
   - Right‑click the browser shortcut → **Properties** → *Target*: make sure nothing extra is appended after `chrome.exe` or `msedge.exe` (`http://…` is a red flag).

4. **Reset the network path**  
   Open **PowerShell (Admin)** and run:  
   ```powershell
   netsh winsock reset
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```
   Then set clean DNS (Cloudflare or Quad9) in adapter settings to bypass sketchy resolvers. If you’re also seeing Wi‑Fi weirdness, check: [/posts/router-interference-apartments/](/posts/router-interference-apartments/) and local providers: [/posts/isps-in-kirksville/](/posts/isps-in-kirksville/)

5. **Look for unwanted programs & tasks**  
   - Windows: *Apps & features* → sort by **Install date**; remove anything that arrived with the symptoms.  
   - Task Scheduler → *Task Scheduler Library* → look for odd “update” tasks that launch browsers.

6. **Browser reset / cleanup**  
   - Chrome: *Settings → Reset settings → Restore settings to their original defaults*. Support doc: [Chrome reset](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214)  
   - Edge: *Reset settings* similar.  
   - Firefox: *Help → More troubleshooting information → Refresh Firefox*. Support doc: [Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)

7. **Scan with a reputable on‑demand tool**  
   Run a second opinion scanner in addition to your resident AV. After cleaning, reboot and test again.

8. **Check sync before re‑enabling**  
   Temporarily sign out of browser sync, clean locally, confirm the fix, then sign back in. If the issue returns immediately, a second device is re‑syncing the problem.

9. **Back up key data before heavy changes**  
   If you’re about to reset or refresh profiles, export bookmarks/passwords first. Backup workflow: [/posts/simple-data-backups-without-cloud/](/posts/simple-data-backups-without-cloud/)

## Patterns that point to the cause

- **Tabs open on a schedule even with no browser window** → notification permission or scheduled task.  
- **Tabs open only when a specific site is open** → that site or one of its extensions is injecting.  
- **Every browser shows it** → OS‑level proxy/DNS or a program launching them.  
- **Only one profile** → a profile‑specific extension or startup page.  
- **Returns after every login** → sync is restoring the bad extension/settings.

If performance is also choppy while the tabs spawn, you might be fighting broader system load or disk issues—see: [/posts/why-does-my-computer-freeze-or-lag-randomly/](/posts/why-does-my-computer-freeze-or-lag-randomly/)

## When to pause and get help

- The browser keeps reinstalling the same extension after you remove it.  
- You find a persistent proxy/DNS that won’t stay cleared.  
- Pop‑ups return across accounts/devices (needs deeper profile/sync triage).  
Hands‑on, we can isolate per‑profile issues, clear scheduled tasks, and lock down DNS and notifications for good.

### Insight
Random tabs are usually behavior you *accidentally allowed* (notifications) or software you *accidentally installed* (extensions/updaters). The fix is to regain **control of the edges**—extensions, notifications, shortcuts, DNS/proxy—then make those settings explicit so they don’t drift back. Once the edges are clean, the center (your browsing) gets peaceful again.

**Need a thorough cleanup and hardening in Kirksville—extension audits, DNS sanity, and a profile reset that sticks?**
