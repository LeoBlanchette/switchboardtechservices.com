Likely causes:

- Windows using cached sign-in and refusing without network; switch to a local sign-in temporarily.
- Adapter disabled or in airplane mode.
- Router DHCP hiccups; renew IP or reboot the router.
- Captive portal on guest Wi-Fi blocking access.
- Date/time drift breaking SSL and logins.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Microsoft account sign‑in needs a network**  
  When Windows thinks you must re‑authenticate a **Microsoft account**, it can block login if there’s no internet or SSL fails. A temporary **local account** login can get you in to fix networking.

- **Radio off / airplane mode**  
  A single **Fn** key or toggle can disable Wi‑Fi/BT. Laptops and small desktops do this often; check the quick settings pane.

- **DHCP / router hiccup**  
  If your PC has an **APIPA** address (169.254.x.x), it didn’t get an IP from the router. Renewing the lease or rebooting the router usually clears this. Sane small‑town router defaults: [/posts/router-settings-small-town/](/posts/router-settings-small-town/)

- **Captive portal in the way**  
  Guest Wi‑Fi at coffee shops, hotels, or even some ISP gateways require a **captive portal** click‑through before you get real internet. Background: [Captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal)

- **Bad time/SSL**  
  Large date/time drift breaks certificates and logins, making Windows think “offline.” Fix time sync first. Background: [Network Time Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)

- **DNS/proxy leftovers**  
  A stuck proxy or bad DNS server can make the web look “down” from this PC only. Resetting Winsock/DNS often restores reachability. Local provider context: [/posts/isps-in-kirksville/](/posts/isps-in-kirksville/)

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **Try a local sign‑in (if you see the login screen)**  
   If your Microsoft account fails, click **Sign‑in options** → choose **PIN/Password**. If you also have a **local account**, sign into that. Once at the desktop, fix networking below.

2. **Verify radio & airplane mode**  
   - Press `Win + A` → ensure **Airplane mode** is **Off** and **Wi‑Fi** is **On**.  
   - Hardware toggle: many laptops use **Fn + (antenna icon)**. On desktops, check Ethernet link light.

3. **Renew IP & reset the stack**  
   Open **PowerShell (Admin)** and run:  
   ```powershell
   ipconfig /release
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ipconfig /renew
   netsh winsock reset
   ```
   Then reconnect to Wi‑Fi/Ethernet and test again. If Wi‑Fi is unstable indoors, see placement tips: [/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/](/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/)

4. **Open the captive portal**  
   If you’re on guest Wi‑Fi, try visiting `http://neverssl.com/` to trigger the portal page. Complete the login/agree step, then retry apps.

5. **Force a clean DNS**  
   Set the adapter’s DNS to a known good resolver (e.g., Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 or Quad9 9.9.9.9) and retest. If the issue vanishes, your old DNS was the culprit.

6. **Time sync**  
   - Right‑click the clock → **Adjust date and time** → enable **Set time automatically** and **Set time zone automatically** → **Sync now**.  
   - Or run:  
   ```powershell
   w32tm /resync
   ```

7. **Network profile sanity**  
   Ensure the current network is **Private** (not Public) if you need discovery/SMB printing. Updates sometimes flip this. Discovery basics are in the printer guide: [/posts/why-cant-my-computer-connect-to-the-printer-after-a-windows-update/](/posts/why-cant-my-computer-connect-to-the-printer-after-a-windows-update/)

8. **Last resort: create a temporary local account**  
   If you’re hard‑locked, boot to **Safe Mode with Networking**, create a local admin, log in, and repair the network path. General boot mindset: [/posts/the-art-of-making-things-boot/](/posts/the-art-of-making-things-boot/)

## Patterns that point to the cause

- **169.254.x.x address** → DHCP failure; router or Wi‑Fi association issue.  
- **Only web pages fail but ping by IP works** → DNS problem; set clean DNS.  
- **Portal shows on phone but not PC** → cached DNS/proxy; reset stack or hit a plain HTTP site to trigger.  
- **Clock is wildly wrong** → SSL handshake fails; sync time first.  
- **Wi‑Fi sees the SSID but won’t join** → band/security mismatch; check settings here: [/posts/router-settings-small-town/](/posts/router-settings-small-town/)

## When to pause and get hands‑on help

- You’re repeatedly thrown back to the login screen with “device is offline.”  
- The NIC shows errors or disappears in Device Manager (possible driver/hardware fault).  
- Captive portals never load despite resets (layer‑7 filtering, DNS hijack, or firewall rules).  
An on‑site survey—stack reset, DNS cleanup, and a router sanity pass—usually restores predictable connectivity fast.

### Insight
“Offline” can be a lie told by one broken link: radio → DHCP → DNS → SSL → account token. Fix them in that order. Once the basics (IP, DNS, time) are clean, sign‑ins stop failing mysteriously. Predictable networking is built on explicit choices: known SSIDs, sane DHCP/DNS, and time that matches the universe.
