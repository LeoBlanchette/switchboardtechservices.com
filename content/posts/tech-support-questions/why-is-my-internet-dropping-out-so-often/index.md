A few likely culprits:

- Router placement and interference (microwaves, fish tanks, brick walls).
- Overcrowded 2.4 GHz channel; a quick channel scan can help.
- ISP modem signal issues or aging coax/connectors.
- Firmware bugs on the router; reboot helps, firmware update helps more.
- Device power saving turning off Wi-Fi adapters intermittently.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Placement & obstacles**  
  Wi-Fi hates water and masonry. Aquariums, brick fireplaces, and metal racks can scatter or absorb signal. See practical placement notes and real-world examples here: [/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/](/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/)

- **Congested 2.4 GHz**  
  In apartments and dense neighborhoods, overlapping 2.4 GHz channels create constant retries that look like “random” drops. 5 GHz (or 6 GHz if supported) and a clean channel usually stabilize things. More on shared-air headaches: [/posts/router-interference-apartments/](/posts/router-interference-apartments/)

- **ISP side signal**  
  Loose F-connectors, moisture-wicked coax, or a tired modem can cause momentary loss of sync. If drops hit every few minutes or hours on *all* devices, suspect the line or modem. Local provider context: [/posts/isps-in-kirksville/](/posts/isps-in-kirksville/)

- **Router firmware / memory pressure**  
  Older routers leak memory or crash under heavy traffic (cloud backup, game updates, smart-home chatter). A firmware update or a scheduled reboot can buy time; a modern router is the long fix. Good defaults and small-town-safe settings: [/posts/router-settings-small-town/](/posts/router-settings-small-town/)

- **Client power saving**  
  Laptops and phones sometimes “nap” their radios. On Windows, check Device Manager → Network Adapter → Power Management and uncheck “Allow the computer to turn off…”.

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **Map the signal in the rooms that matter**  
   Stand where drops happen and note bars and *speed consistency* (not just peak). If walls or appliances are suspects, shift the router a few feet and retest. Room-by-room guidance: [/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/](/posts/kirksville-wifi-dead-zones/)

2. **Separate SSIDs and bands**  
   Give 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz different names (e.g., `Home-2G` and `Home-5G`). Put streaming/gaming on 5 GHz. Keep smart plugs/cameras on 2.4 GHz.

3. **Pick a clean channel**  
   Use the router’s auto-optimize, then manually set channels 1/6/11 on 2.4 GHz; pick a DFS-capable channel on 5 GHz if your devices support it. Settings walk-through: [/posts/router-settings-small-town/](/posts/router-settings-small-town/)

4. **Direct-wire a suspect device**  
   Plug one device into the router via Ethernet for an evening. If drops vanish *only* on Ethernet, the WAN is probably fine and Wi-Fi is the culprit. If Ethernet also drops, look upstream to the modem/ISP.

5. **Power and path sanity check**  
   Ensure the ISP line hits the modem first, then a short known-good Ethernet to the router’s WAN. Remove splitters and unnecessary couplers. Hand-tighten coax ends.

6. **Firmware + reboot cadence**  
   Update router and modem firmware if available. As a stopgap, schedule a weekly router reboot during off-hours.

## When to call the ISP vs. when to call a tech

- **Call the ISP** when the modem’s *WAN* light drops or the status page shows T3/T4 timeouts, or when *every* device (even wired) drops together. Note timestamps; ask for a line check and signal levels. Context: [/posts/isps-in-kirksville/](/posts/isps-in-kirksville/)

- **Call a local tech** when Wi-Fi is weak in certain rooms, certain devices misbehave, you need a mesh/AP placement plan, or you want VLAN/guest setups that don’t brick the household.

If you’re in multi-unit housing with competing routers on the same channels, these tips help tame the chaos: [/posts/router-interference-apartments/](/posts/router-interference-apartments/)

### Insight
Internet reliability is a chain: wall jack → modem sync → router brain → radio environment → client device. Drops happen where *variability* is highest—usually RF (air) and old firmware. Treat it like fieldwork: isolate each link with one simple test, make one change at a time, and watch for stability over hours, not minutes. The goal isn’t max speed; it’s **predictability**. A stable 100 Mbps beats a flaky “gigabit” that collapses during family movie night.
