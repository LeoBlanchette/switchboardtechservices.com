A few angles:

- Charger wattage too low or failing; test with a known-good.
- DC jack damage or loose internal connection.
- Battery wear level high; check with OEM utility.
- Firmware/EC issues; BIOS update sometimes helps.
- USB-C PD negotiation quirks with third-party cables.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Underpowered or failing charger**  
  Many laptops negotiate specific wattage. If the adapter can’t supply enough (e.g., using a 45 W brick for a 90 W laptop), you’ll see “Plugged in, not charging” or the battery will drain while in use.

- **DC jack / charge port wear**  
  Barrel‑jack sockets and some USB‑C ports loosen or crack their solder joints over time. Wiggle‑sensitive charging or intermittent LEDs point here.

- **Battery wear level**  
  Lithium cells lose capacity and may refuse to accept charge beyond a certain wear threshold. OEM utilities can show **Design Capacity** vs **Full Charge Capacity**.

- **Firmware / EC (embedded controller) state**  
  The charging controller can get stuck after sleep/hibernation or an update. A full power drain or BIOS/EC update often restores normal behavior.

- **USB‑C Power Delivery oddities**  
  Not all USB‑C cables carry **e‑markers** or high current. Some ports are **data‑only** or **charge‑in only**. Background: [USB Power Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Power_Delivery)

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **Confirm the required wattage**  
   Read the label on your laptop or OEM adapter (e.g., 19.5 V ⎓ 6.15 A ≈ 120 W). Use an adapter that meets or exceeds it. If the LED on the brick flickers or is dim, suspect the brick.

2. **Test with a known‑good charger/cable**  
   - **Barrel jack**: try another OEM‑rated adapter if available.  
   - **USB‑C**: use a 60–100 W **PD‑rated** cable/charger. Avoid thin, data‑only cables—look for e‑marked cables for >3 A charging.

3. **Inspect the port and plug**  
   Check for wobble, scorching, lint, or bent pins. Gently clean lint from USB‑C with a wooden toothpick; avoid metal tools.

4. **Battery and AC behavior**  
   - If removable, test **AC‑only** with battery out (if the laptop supports it).  
   - If it runs on AC but won’t charge the battery, the **charge path** or the battery itself is likely at fault.

5. **Power reset / EC reset**  
   Shut down → unplug AC → hold power 15–20 seconds (drains capacitors). On some models, a tiny **reset pinhole** exists on the bottom—press as per OEM manual.

6. **BIOS/UEFI & EC update**  
   Install the latest stable BIOS/EC. Some vendors also have **battery calibration** tools. General prep before firmware updates: [/posts/prepare-for-computer-repair/](/posts/prepare-for-computer-repair/)

7. **Check wear level**  
   - **Windows**: `powercfg /batteryreport` (view the HTML report) shows Design vs Full charge capacity and cycle count.  
   - **Linux**: `upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT)` or read `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/` for capacity and cycles.

8. **Vendor “battery conservation” modes**  
   Many laptops stop at **80%** to extend lifespan (Lenovo, ASUS, etc.). Disable temporarily to test. Re‑enable if you want longevity once charging works.

9. **Try the other USB‑C port (if present)**  
   Some laptops only support charging on **one** USB‑C port, or only on the port with a charging icon. Try both orientations and ports.

## Patterns that point to the cause

- **Charges when the plug is held at an angle** → loose **DC jack** or worn USB‑C port.  
- **Runs on AC but battery % never increases** → aged battery or failed charging FET/sense line.  
- **Charges on OEM brick but not third‑party** → PD negotiation or wattage shortfall.  
- **Stuck at exactly 80%** → vendor conservation mode.  
- **Stops charging after sleep until full shutdown** → EC/firmware glitch; update/reset.

## When to pause and get hands‑on help

- **DC jack is loose**, sparks, or shows heat damage.  
- Battery is **swollen** (chassis bulge, trackpad click issues)—power down and seek service immediately.  
- Battery wear shows **very low Full Charge Capacity** and calibration doesn’t help—replacement time.  
Bench testing with a lab‑rated charger and port inspection can separate charger, jack, battery, and board issues quickly.

### Insight
Charging is a negotiation between **source**, **port**, **controller**, and **cells**. If any one link lies, the pack refuses to take energy. Start at the wall (adequate wattage), confirm a clean physical path (jack/cable), reset the controller (EC/BIOS), and then judge the battery by its numbers—not vibes. Healthy systems charge predictably; when they don’t, the data will tell you which link is out of tune.
