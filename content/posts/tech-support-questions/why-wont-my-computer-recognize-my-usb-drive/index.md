Likely causes:

- Port power issues; try a rear I/O port or a powered hub.
- Drive letter collision; assign a new letter in Disk Management.
- File system corruption; check with "chkdsk" or test on another PC.
- Missing chipset/USB drivers after a reinstall.
- ExFAT/NTFS compatibility issues on older systems.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Power and port quirks**  
  Front‑panel ports and unpowered hubs can brown‑out larger flash drives and portable HDDs. Rear motherboard ports usually deliver steadier power. For backup safety before experimenting: [/posts/simple-data-backups-without-cloud/](/posts/simple-data-backups-without-cloud/)

- **Drive letter collision / offline volume (Windows)**  
  Windows can mount a drive but hide it if the assigned letter is already taken or the volume is set **Offline**. Fix in **Disk Management**.

- **File system trouble**  
  A dirty bit or minor corruption can prevent mounting. `chkdsk` often repairs this. Background: [CHKDSK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk)

- **Missing/old USB or chipset drivers**  
  After a fresh OS install, USB controllers may use generic drivers that don’t fully enumerate devices. Vendor chipset/USB drivers usually restore stability.

- **Format compatibility**  
  Older OS builds may lack **exFAT** support or have limited **NTFS** write support (on some non‑Windows systems). Primer: [exFAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT), [USB mass storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class)

- **Physical device failure**  
  Worn flash memory or a bent connector can make a drive intermittent or invisible. If the drive feels hot or disconnects when touched, suspect hardware.

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **Try a known‑good port and cable**  
   Plug into a rear I/O USB port (desktop) or a different port (laptop). Avoid unpowered hubs for testing. If it’s a 2.5" USB HDD, use a **Y‑cable** or powered hub.

2. **See if the OS detects *anything***  
   - **Windows**: `Win + X` → **Disk Management**. Do you see the disk or an **Unknown/Unallocated** entry?  
   - **Linux**: `lsusb` and `dmesg -w` while you plug it in—look for enumeration messages.

3. **Assign a drive letter (Windows)**  
   In **Disk Management**, right‑click the volume → **Change Drive Letter and Paths…** → **Add** or **Change** → pick a letter far down the alphabet.

4. **Run a non‑destructive file system check (Windows)**  
   Open **PowerShell (Admin)** and run:  
   ```powershell
   chkdsk E: /scan
   ```
   Replace `E:` with the correct letter. If it reports errors, run:
   ```powershell
   chkdsk E: /f
   ```
   Microsoft reference: [CHKDSK command](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk)

5. **Check Device Manager for controller issues**  
   `Win + X` → **Device Manager** → *Universal Serial Bus controllers*. If devices show warnings, right‑click → **Uninstall device**, then **Scan for hardware changes**. Install vendor **chipset/USB** drivers afterward.

6. **Test on another computer**  
   If it works elsewhere, copy critical data immediately. If it fails everywhere, it’s likely the drive itself. Prep for intake: [/posts/prepare-for-computer-repair/](/posts/prepare-for-computer-repair/)

7. **As a last resort: recover files before reformatting**  
   If the partition table is damaged, consider imaging the device first. When you’re ready to reformat for widest compatibility, use **exFAT** for cross‑platform, **NTFS** for Windows‑centric, **ext4** for Linux.

## Patterns that point to the cause

- **Shows in Device Manager but no drive letter** → assign a letter or bring the disk **Online** in Disk Management.  
- **Visible as “Unknown/Not Initialized”** → partition table damage; recover data first.  
- **Works on one machine but not another** → driver/port issue on the failing PC.  
- **Disconnects when touched** → loose connector or failing drive.

If your end goal is a bootable USB (installers, rescue media), use this guide after the drive is healthy: [/posts/boot-from-usb-every-major-system/](/posts/boot-from-usb-every-major-system/)

## When to pause and get help

- The drive makes **clicking** sounds or overheats.  
- `chkdsk` reports bad sectors repeatedly.  
- Disk Management asks to **Initialize** a drive that contains important files.  
A quick bench test, imaging, and safe recovery workflow can save your data before anything destructive happens.

### Insight
USB storage is a three‑part handshake: **power**, **enumeration**, and **filesystem**. If power is marginal, enumeration fails; if enumeration works but the filesystem is dirty, the OS hides it. Triage in that order—stable power, confirmed detection, then careful repair—and you’ll solve most cases with minimal risk to your data.
