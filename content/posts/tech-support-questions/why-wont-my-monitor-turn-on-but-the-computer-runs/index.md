A few possibilities:

- Wrong input selected on the monitor (HDMI1 vs HDMI2, DP, etc.).
- Cable or adapter failure (cheap DP to HDMI can be flaky).
- GPU not fully seated or needs auxiliary PCIe power.
- iGPU vs dGPU output confusion; plug into the active one.
- Dead backlight on laptops though the system boots.

## What it might be (likely causes)

- **Monitor input or power state**  
  Many monitors default to the last input and won’t auto‑switch. If the on‑screen display (OSD) works, the panel has power—cycle inputs manually and verify brightness isn’t at zero. Background: [HDMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI), [DisplayPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort)

- **Cable/adapter failure**  
  Damaged HDMI/DP cables and fragile DP→HDMI adapters cause black screens or “no signal.” Test with a short, known‑good cable and avoid daisy‑chained adapters.

- **Graphics output confusion (iGPU vs dGPU)**  
  Desktops with a graphics card often disable the motherboard video ports. Plug into the **GPU’s** ports, not the motherboard’s. On small form factor PCs or after BIOS updates, the inverse can happen—only the iGPU is live.

- **Seat & power for the GPU**  
  A partially seated GPU or missing **PCIe power connectors** (6/8‑pin) will spin fans but output nothing. Reseat the card and cables firmly.

- **Laptop backlight/panel issues**  
  The system can boot with a dead backlight. A bright flashlight at an angle may reveal a faint image—external monitor output can confirm the machine is otherwise fine.

- **Firmware/handshake quirks**  
  Some combinations require a full power cycle: shut down PC and monitor, unplug the monitor for 30 seconds, then reconnect. DP “hot‑plug detect” can get stuck.

## Things to check (quick, safe wins)

1. **OSD check first**  
   Press the monitor’s menu button. If the OSD shows, the panel is powered—use the input/source menu to pick the correct HDMI/DP port. Try a different port on the monitor.

2. **Known‑good cable & port**  
   Swap in a different HDMI/DP cable (short, high‑quality). Move the cable to another port on the GPU and on the monitor. Avoid passive DP↔HDMI adapters during testing.

3. **Plug into the right graphics output**  
   On desktops, connect to the **graphics card’s** ports (not the motherboard). If no signal, remove the GPU temporarily and try the motherboard port to verify baseline video.

4. **Reseat GPU & power**  
   Power down, switch off the PSU, hold the power button 5 seconds. Reseat the GPU, lock the retention clip, and attach all required PCIe power leads. Ensure the 8‑pin/6‑pin connectors click in.

5. **Try a different display**  
   Connect a different monitor or a TV. If that works, suspect the original monitor or cable. If neither works, suspect GPU/port/firmware.

6. **BIOS/UEFI video settings**  
   If you only get video on the iGPU, check BIOS/UEFI for **Primary Display** / **Init Display First** settings. Set to PCIe/PEG for a discrete card. General boot/firmware mindset: [/posts/the-art-of-making-things-boot/](/posts/the-art-of-making-things-boot/)

7. **Laptop external display test**  
   For laptops, toggle display modes with **Win + P** (Windows) to cycle Duplicate/Extend/Second screen only. If internal panel is black but external works, it’s likely a panel/backlight or cable issue.

8. **Safe mode / basic driver**  
   If you briefly see the vendor logo then black, boot into **Safe Mode** to test with a basic driver. Persistent black screens after driver installs point to GPU/driver issues—roll back.

9. **Physical inspection**  
   Look for bent pins on adapters, damaged ports, or dust in DP latches. For desktops moved recently, verify no standoffs or cables are shorting near the GPU.

## Patterns that narrow the cause

- **OSD visible, “No Signal”** → input/cable/handshake problem.  
- **No OSD at all** → monitor has no power or panel/backlight failure.  
- **Only motherboard video works** → GPU seat/power or BIOS primary display mis‑set.  
- **Laptop shows on external only** → internal panel/backlight or ribbon cable.

## When to pause and get hands‑on help

- GPU fans spin but **no output on any port** with known‑good cables and displays.  
- Monitor powers but **backlight is out** (image visible only with flashlight).  
- Ports feel loose, spark, or show physical damage.  
A bench test with spare GPUs, cables, and a controlled power cycle isolates the failure quickly.

### Insight
A black screen isn’t always a dead PC; it’s usually a broken **chain**: source → cable/adapter → input → panel. Test each link with the simplest substitution you can. Monitors are talkative—if the OSD works, the panel’s alive. If motherboard video works but the GPU doesn’t, physics, not magic: seat it, power it, then configure it.
