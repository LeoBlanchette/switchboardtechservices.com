# What to Do Before You Bring Your Computer for Repair

_By Switchboard Tech Services -- Kirksville, Missouri_

Before you hand over your laptop or desktop for repair, there are a few smart things you can do to protect your data and save time. These steps make the repair smoother for both you and the technician. Most take just a few minutes, and they can prevent headaches later.

## 1. Back up your important files

Repairs are usually safe, but accidents happen. A backup ensures you do not lose photos, documents, or project files if your drive fails or needs to be wiped.

Options include:
- Copying files to a USB flash drive or external hard drive  
- Syncing to a local NAS (network-attached storage)  
- Using offline backup tools (no cloud login required)

If you do not have a backup method, we can help you set one up during or after your repair.

## 2. Log out of personal accounts

Your technician does not need access to your private emails or social media. Sign out of personal accounts where possible, especially:
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird)
- Messaging apps (Discord, Telegram, etc.)

If your repair involves reinstalling the system, we will need to log in briefly for testing -- but local accounts or temporary logins are fine.

## 3. Write down what is happening

A few details can make diagnosis much faster. Before dropping off your computer, jot down:
- When the issue started  
- What you were doing when it happened  
- Any recent updates or new hardware/software  
- Whether it happens every time or randomly  

Example: “Laptop shuts off after 10 minutes, even when plugged in.”  
That kind of note is gold for troubleshooting.

## 4. Bring your power adapter and any special accessories

Half of all "won’t turn on" tickets start with a missing power cable. Always bring:
- The power adapter (for laptops)
- Any external devices that may be related to the issue
- Your Wi-Fi dongle or keyboard dongle if it is a wireless setup

We can test most standard gear, but having your exact setup avoids confusion.

## 5. Keep your passwords handy

If your system has a login password, write it down somewhere secure. We cannot test repairs properly if we cannot log in.  
If you prefer privacy, create a temporary password before dropping it off. We can change it back afterward.

## 6. Do not panic -- most issues are fixable

Slow performance, no power, or flickering screens often sound worse than they are. Many times it is just a bad drive, a failing battery, or a corrupted update.  

At Switchboard Tech Services, we specialize in bringing devices back from the brink without unnecessary replacements. If the cost of repair outweighs the benefit, we will tell you upfront.
