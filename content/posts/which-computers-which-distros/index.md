So your computer wheezes like a harmonica every time you open a browser tab.  
Before you send it to the great recycling bin in the sky, there’s a good chance it just needs a lighter operating system -- not a eulogy.

Linux has dozens of flavors, and some are **shockingly good** at reviving old machines.  
We’re talking systems that make a dusty 2010 laptop feel like it just downed an espresso.

You don’t need to guess which version will run best -- we already did the homework (and the trial installs, and the BIOS wrestling).  
Check out our complete compatibility cheat sheet here:  
[**The Old Computer Linux Compatibility Guide**](/posts/old-computer-linux-compatability-guide/)

It lists real makes, models, and year ranges with the best Linux match for each -- organized, verified, and very nerd-approved.  
Save a computer. Learn a new skill. Upset Big Tech a little.
