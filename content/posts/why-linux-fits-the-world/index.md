Your Linux system uses the same foundations that power the major systems of the world.  
When you open your terminal, you’re working within the same architecture trusted by banks, data centers, and entire governments.

## Core Linux Directories

- **/** – The root of the filesystem. Every path begins here.  
- **/bin** – Essential binaries and commands (`ls`, `cp`, `bash`), available to all users.  
- **/boot** – Kernel and bootloader files; what gets your system started.  
- **/dev** – Hardware device interfaces like drives and serial ports.  
- **/etc** – Configuration files for the system and installed services.  
- **/home** – Personal user directories — your documents, downloads, and settings.  
- **/lib** – Shared libraries and kernel modules required for system binaries.  
- **/media** – Mount points for external devices (USB drives, DVDs).  
- **/mnt** – Temporary mount point for manually attached filesystems.  
- **/opt** – Optional or third-party software.  
- **/proc** – Virtual filesystem that represents live system and process info.  
- **/root** – Home directory for the root (administrator) user.  
- **/run** – Runtime process data since the last boot.  
- **/sbin** – System binaries for administrative tasks (`fsck`, `reboot`).  
- **/srv** – Data served by the system (like web or FTP).  
- **/tmp** – Temporary files deleted on reboot.  
- **/usr** – User-installed applications and utilities.  
- **/var** – Variable data such as logs, mail spools, and caches.

## Security and Reliability

When you use Linux, you inherit the same battle-tested security and engineering principles that the world’s largest systems rely on.  
The same architecture that keeps the global web stable also keeps your laptop calm under pressure.

## Factoids: Linux Around the World

- **Over 96% of the world’s top 1 million web servers** run Linux.  
- **The New York Stock Exchange** operates on Linux-based systems for performance and uptime.  
- **Android**, the world’s most-used operating system, is built on the Linux kernel.  
- **Supercomputers:** Every single one of the world’s top 500 supercomputers runs Linux.  
- **Banking and finance networks** depend on Linux for secure transaction handling.  
- **The Internet itself** — from DNS servers to routers — runs on Linux or Unix-like systems.  
- **Hollywood studios** rely on Linux render farms for film production (Pixar, DreamWorks, Weta).  
- **Government agencies** such as the U.S. Department of Defense and the French Gendarmerie Nationale have migrated systems to Linux for security and cost reasons.

Linux isn’t just another operating system — it’s the shared infrastructure of the modern world.  
Running Linux means joining the same global system that keeps everything else running smoothly.
