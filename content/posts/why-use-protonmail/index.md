# Why You Should Use ProtonMail in Kirksville: The Email That Doesnt Spy on You

_By Switchboard Tech Services -- Kirksville, Missouri_

Most people know Google gives away Gmail for free.  
What they dont realize is that "free" email costs more than they think -- not in dollars, but in **privacy**.

## How Google Snoops (and Why Its Worse Than You Think)

Lets be honest: Google reads your mail like a nosy neighbor with binoculars.

Every receipt you get from Amazon? Logged.  
Every flight confirmation, appointment, or "you up?" message? Indexed.  
Every emotional rant you wrote after two glasses of wine? Cataloged like a rare bird.

Google doesnt just peek in your inbox -- it practically moves in.  
If your Gmail were a house, Google would not only open your underwear drawer but photograph its contents, note the color palette, estimate replacement value, and then sell ads for laundry detergent.

Thats not exaggeration.  
Google literally parses message contents and metadata -- who you write, when, how often, what you buy, what events you attend -- and uses that data to refine ad targeting.  
They know when youve been shopping, they know when youre awake, and they definitely know when youve been emailing your ex.

Theyre not *evil*, just *efficiently omniscient*.  
And in Kirksville, wed call that "a little much."

## Enter ProtonMail: The Inbox with a Lock on It

Now imagine the opposite.

You open your email, send a message, and **nobody -- not even the company that runs it -- can read whats inside**.

Thats ProtonMail.

Founded by scientists from CERN (yes, the people who built the Large Hadron Collider), ProtonMail was designed to stop exactly the kind of data harvesting that Big Tech thrives on.  
Its based in Switzerland, protected by strong privacy laws, and built on **end-to-end encryption** -- meaning your messages are scrambled before they even reach the server.  
Not even Proton can open them.

Where Googles model depends on knowing everything about you, Protons depends on knowing *nothing*.  
They dont track you, dont inject ads, and dont care about your shopping habits or your cat photos.  
They care that your email gets from point A to point B without being turned into marketing gold along the way.

## What That Means in Real Life

Youre not going to get targeted ads because you mentioned "chainsaw" in an email.  
Youre not going to see insurance ads because you scheduled a doctors appointment.  
Youre not going to wake up wondering how your inbox guessed your mood.

Instead, youll get a clean, fast interface -- no clutter, no nonsense.  
And the best part? It feels *peaceful*.  
Checking ProtonMail feels like stepping into a quiet workshop instead of a mall food court.

## Why Its Worth Paying For (Even If You Dont Have To)

Yes, theres a free version. But the paid plan is where it shines.

You can use your own custom domain (like `you@yourkirksvillebusiness.com`), get more storage, and connect to desktop mail apps through Protons secure Bridge.  
Youre not paying for "features." Youre paying for **freedom from surveillance** -- and thats worth more than a Netflix subscription.
