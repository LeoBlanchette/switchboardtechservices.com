# Windows Has Declared Itself Disposable

Windows 10 reached its end of updates in **October 2025**. Microsoft quietly confirmed what many of us suspected for years: their operating systems aren’t built to last -- they’re built to expire.

Security patches have stopped, older hardware isn’t supported, and Windows 11 is already leaving millions of working machines behind. The message is clear: your computer still runs fine, but the software has decided it’s tired of you.

## An Operating System Should Serve You -- Not the Other Way Around

There was a time when software existed to make your life easier. Today, Windows mostly makes your data more valuable. Between forced online accounts, advertising built into the Start menu, and “telemetry” that tracks your usage, it’s clear who the real customer is -- and it’s not you.

The modern OS has become something else entirely: a delivery platform for ads, subscriptions, and behavioral data. Every update seems to bring more pop-ups, more integration you didn’t ask for, and less control over the system you paid for.

## Linux: The Return of the Honest Computer OS

Here’s the part most people in Kirksville don’t know yet: Linux isn’t the tinkerer’s system it used to be. It’s clean, stable, and fully capable of handling everything Windows once did -- browsing, office work, media, and even gaming.

But more importantly, Linux doesn’t spy on you. It doesn’t sell your habits, push ads, or decide when to reboot. It just runs -- quietly, reliably, and often faster than before.

When you install Linux, you’re choosing to make your computer *yours again.*

## Out With the Old, In With the Free

Times are changing. Windows is trying to become something it was never meant to be -- a social media service, an advertising platform, and lately, a playground for half-baked AI integrations.

Linux has become what it was always destined to be: the backbone of the modern world. It powers the Internet, most of the servers you connect to daily, the majority of supercomputers, and countless devices you depend on.

It can power your home computer, too -- cleanly, quietly, stable, and supported.
