## Introduction

> NOTE: This is still young in production. 

**AltGrid Live** is a portable Linux operating system built for independence. It’s a **Debian-based live USB environment** that can transform nearly any computer into a functional off-grid workstation — complete with **LoRa radio communication**, scripting tools, and a curated offline toolkit.  
You can think of it as *[Tails](https://tails.net/) for the resilient technologist*: focused not on anonymity, but **self-reliance**.

Where Tails protects your identity, AltGrid Live protects your *autonomy*.

### Purpose and Vision

AltGrid Live is part of the [AltGrid Project](https://github.com/AltGrid/), which develops open-source systems for communication and survival when the cloud is gone and the network grid is unreliable.  
Its mission is to make computing useful **without requiring the internet**, subscriptions, or proprietary services.

The system ships as a self-contained USB stick that boots directly into a fully configured Linux desktop — no installation needed. Plug it into an old laptop, and you have an instant radio node, local document vault, and repair lab.

### Core Capabilities

- **LoRa Communication via ViaText**  
  Out of the box, AltGrid Live can pair with [ViaText](https://github.com/AltGrid/viatext-core) nodes to send messages through low-power radio — no phone, SIM, or Wi-Fi required. It’s effectively a portable post office for your field devices. 

- **Offline Toolkit**  
  Comes pre-loaded with editors, diagnostic tools, and documentation for fieldwork: text processing, network sniffing, serial monitoring, and more — all runnable without internet access.

- **Persistence Optional**  
  Like Tails, it can run in temporary mode or preserve changes between sessions. You decide whether to keep logs, configs, and encryption keys.

- **Linux-Native Familiarity**  
  Everything follows traditional Debian conventions. If you can use a terminal, you can understand how it works. Nothing is hidden behind custom interfaces.

### Why It Exists

Most modern systems assume constant connectivity. AltGrid Live is built for the moments — or environments — where that’s impossible.  
Rural communities, disaster zones, field stations, research trips, or just digital minimalists who want control of their tools.

It’s a platform for **digital self-sufficiency**, blending Linux pragmatism with open-hardware communication.

### In Short

AltGrid Live is your **pocket-sized Linux basecamp** — a bootable system for communication, repair, and survival when the network ends but the work continues.

> **Build like it’s 1986. Communicate like it’s 2086.**
