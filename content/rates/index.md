## Clear and Simple Pricing

I keep rates straightforward so you know what to expect.  

| Service                  | Rate        |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Tech Support              | $35 / hour  |
| Coaching & Tutoring       | $20 / hour  |
| Light Miscellaneous Labor | $20 / hour  |
| Heavy Miscellaneous Labor | $35 / hour  |

## How It Works

- **Hourly, not hidden fees** — I charge for time on the job, not surprise add-ons.  
- **Family effort** — We are a team, and members of Switchboard Tech Services, LLC. 
- **Tech focus first** — Most of my work is technical service and support. Non-technical labor is offered only when it makes sense and our schedule allows.  
- **No fix, no charge** — If something can’t be repaired, I’ll say so and you don’t pay.

## Why This Matters

As a general service, I’ve kept pricing simple so you can budget with confidence.  
Whether it’s troubleshooting computers, teaching a system, or pitching in with local labor when help is short, the goal is practical support at clear rates.
