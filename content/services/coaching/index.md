## Learning as Part of the Service

Sometimes the best solution isn’t a repair — it’s learning how to use the system you already have.  
This is especially true with Linux conversions, but it can apply to many other situations in homes and businesses.

## What Coaching Covers

- Getting comfortable after a Linux install  
- Organizing email and files  
- Using office software effectively  
- Setting up printers, networks, and smart devices  
- General “how to” sessions for everyday tech

---

## Practical and Affordable

Coaching costs less than repair or project work.  
The goal is confidence: giving you the skills to handle your own system day to day.

---

## Professional Approach

I treat coaching as professional work:  
- Clear explanations without jargon  
- Respect for your pace and questions  
- Plain advice on what’s worth learning and what’s best left alone

In some cases, unusual or older equipment may require research.  
If that happens, I adapt quickly — and I don’t charge for my learning time.
