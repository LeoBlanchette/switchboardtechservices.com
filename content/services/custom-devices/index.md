## When a Custom Device Makes Sense

There may come a need where store-bought gear won’t solve a recurring problem.  
That’s where **small control boards, sensors, and tiny Linux computers** can help—when a practical, local fix is better than another boxed gadget.

This is specialty work. It isn’t the cheapest path, and it shouldn’t be.  
It’s for cases where **downtime, waste, or repeated headaches** cost more than doing it right once.

## My Background (Plainly)

- **Programming** — Linux, shell, Python, and practical glue code for small systems.  
- **Electronics** — repair, simple control circuits, sensor wiring, and board-level troubleshooting.  
- **Small systems** — Raspberry Pi / Le Potato, microcontrollers, and local dashboards.

Result: I can design **simple, reliable tools** that do one job well.

## Local Use Cases

- **Freezer / fridge alerts** — temperature sensor that **texts you** if it warms up (no cloud account required).  
- **Leak detectors** — washer room / backroom sensors that alert before there’s damage.  
- **Machine helpers** — simple counters or status lights for laundromats or shop equipment.  
- **Tiny file/media servers** — local-first storage or a small dashboard that shows what you actually need.  
- **Bridges** — make two devices “talk” when they weren’t built to (USB↔️network, simple protocol adapters).

If a sturdy off-the-shelf product exists, I’ll point you to it first.

## Process (No Surprises)

1. **Short conversation** — what’s the problem, what’s it costing you, what’s “good enough.”  
2. **Scope** — I’ll suggest the simplest design I think will work. If this shouldn’t be custom, I’ll say so.  
3. **Prototype** — a small build to prove the idea.  
4. **Field test** — run it in place for a bit; adjust if needed.  
5. **Install & handoff** — label wiring, provide plain-English notes, and keep it serviceable.

I don’t charge for my **learning time** when research is needed. If a fix is viable after research, we’ll reconvene before work proceeds.

## Local-First, No Lock-In

- Works **without** a cloud account when possible.  
- You **own the hardware.**  
- Simple docs live with the device (and I keep a copy so it’s not lost).  
- Standard parts where possible so repairs are easy.

---

## Straight Talk on Cost

Custom devices are cost-effective **only** when:  
- the problem repeats,  
- downtime is expensive, or  
- the off-the-shelf option has already failed you.

If it looks like a gamble on an essential or expensive device, I’ll stop and tell you plainly. **No fix, no charge.**

---

## What I Don’t Build

- Safety-critical systems, medical devices, or large building automation.  
- Big cloud stacks.  
- Anything that needs a team to maintain.

## Why This Matters Here

Kirksville shops run on practical tools. My experience with Linux, programming, and electronics means **you have options** when standard gear won’t do.  
If a small, focused device can save you money or hassle, we’ll build it. If not, we won’t.
