## Local and Lean

Switchboard keeps things simple.  
Most service calls within two miles of the courthouse square are done on foot.  

Why? It’s efficient, reliable, and keeps overhead low — which means better value for you.  
For jobs outside that range, I drive as needed.

## What to Expect

- A straightforward, no-frills service model  
- Prompt arrival in the Kirksville core area  
- Focus on the work, not the overhead  

It’s a foot soldier’s approach to tech maintenance: light gear, direct service, steady results.
