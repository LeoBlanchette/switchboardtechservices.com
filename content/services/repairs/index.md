## Oddball Repairs

I handle repairs within my experience: Windows and Linux systems, electronics, and a range of general devices.  

- If the problem is simple and visible on site, I’ll repair it there.  
- If it needs more focus, I’ll ask you to meet me at the courthouse square. Working there lets me handle it with care and concentration.  
- If a device is critical or expensive, and the fix looks uncertain, I’ll stop before risking it.  
- If it can’t be repaired, I’ll tell you directly. No fix, no charge.  

I don’t claim to fix everything — but if it’s in my wheelhouse, I’ll give it my full attention and be honest about the outcome.
