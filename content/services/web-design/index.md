## When You Need More Than a Template

Website design has shifted over the years. There are plenty of cheap, do-it-yourself options — some are fine for quick projects. But when a site breaks, grows stale, or just doesn’t do what you need, those platforms often fall short. That’s where I can help.

## What I Can Do

- **Sleek HTML-only websites**  
  Fast, secure, no clutter. Perfect for a simple business card site, brochure, or portfolio. These work anywhere and last for years without fuss.

- **Dynamic websites**  
  Where needed, I can add forms, blogs, or basic interactive features. I host on Linux servers (Opalstack or similar) so you’re not tied to a single platform.

- **Maintenance, repair, troubleshooting**  
  If you already have a site that’s half-working, throwing errors, or needs to be cleaned up, I can usually get it back on its feet.

## My Approach

I’ve been building and repairing websites for more than a decade, alongside server work and Linux administration. I don’t upsell, and I don’t lock you in. My focus is practical: deliver what makes sense for your situation, whether that’s restoring an old site, standing up a clean new one, or just fixing the part that’s broken.

*If you’re not sure whether your project is “too small,” it probably isn’t. A one-page site that just works can still beat a bloated, broken one.*
