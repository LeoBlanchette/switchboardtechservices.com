I help **anyone** nearby who needs tech support or repair in Kirksville.  
These groups tend to call me most often:

- **Landlords** — quick fixes for tenant gear, laundry boards, Wi-Fi, and appliances.  
- **Shops & cafés** — card readers, printers, POS tablets, Wi-Fi networks.  
- **Retirees** — patient help with phones, email, streaming, and everyday tech.  
- **Students (Truman & ATSU)** — slow laptops, broken Wi-Fi, Linux installs, tutoring.  
- **Churches & offices** — projectors, sound systems, shared printers, backups.

My focus is **close to the courthouse square** — generally within a five mile radius. 

That keeps service responsive and reliable.  

If you’re nearby and need a practical tech fix, I’ll make it work.
