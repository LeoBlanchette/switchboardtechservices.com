&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a computer becomes old, and the original operating system is no longer supported or runs poorly.&lt;br&gt;
That doesn’t mean the hardware is useless. In many cases, a Linux installation will bring it back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-you-can-use-out-of-the-box"&gt;What You Can Use Out of the Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux provides a stable base for everyday tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web browsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office-style documents and spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media playback (music, video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printing and scanning (most devices work automatically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software updates delivered through one central manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these tasks run faster and lighter on Linux than on an aging Windows or macOS installation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>House Calls</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/house-calls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/house-calls/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yes-i-make-house-calls"&gt;Yes, I Make House Calls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provide on-site help for homes and businesses within about &lt;strong&gt;two miles of the courthouse square&lt;/strong&gt; in Kirksville.&lt;br&gt;
This means I can walk to you quickly and reliably. See &lt;a href="https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/foot-soldier/"&gt;Foot Soldier for Tech Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-to-expect"&gt;What to Expect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help with Wi-Fi dead zones, printers, POS tablets, and streaming devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer troubleshooting and Linux conversions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small business service calls (shops, offices, landlords).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straightforward explanations in plain language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="record"&gt;Record&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep things transparent:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tech Repairs</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/repairs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/repairs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="oddball-repairs"&gt;Oddball Repairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk to appointments. This keeps costs low and response reliable. See &lt;a href="https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/foot-soldier/"&gt;Foot Soldier for Tech Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I handle repairs within my experience: Windows and Linux systems, electronics, and a range of general devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the problem is simple and visible on site, I’ll repair it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it needs more focus, I’ll ask you to meet me at the courthouse square. Working there lets me handle it with care and concentration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a device is critical or expensive, and the fix looks uncertain, I’ll stop before risking it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it can’t be repaired, I’ll tell you directly. No fix, no charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t claim to fix everything — but if it’s in my wheelhouse, I’ll give it my full attention and be honest about the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Small Business Tech Maintenance Needs</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/small-business-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/small-business-basics/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-everyday-needs-of-small-business"&gt;The Everyday Needs of Small Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a shop, café, or office in Kirksville means wearing many hats.&lt;br&gt;
Technology is a necessity, but reliable support isn’t always easy to find.&lt;br&gt;
That’s where we help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tech-support-we-provide"&gt;Tech Support We Provide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cover the practical technology small businesses depend on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="point-of-sale-systems"&gt;Point of Sale Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablet registers, card readers, receipt printers, and Wi-Fi connections.&lt;br&gt;
Troubleshooting when they lock up or refuse to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="networking"&gt;Networking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Router setup, extenders for coverage, and simple office file-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Custom Devices</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/custom-devices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/custom-devices/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="when-a-custom-device-makes-sense"&gt;When a Custom Device Makes Sense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may come a need where store-bought gear won’t solve a recurring problem.&lt;br&gt;
That’s where &lt;strong&gt;small control boards, sensors, and tiny Linux computers&lt;/strong&gt; can help—when a practical, local fix is better than another boxed gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is specialty work. It isn’t the cheapest path, and it shouldn’t be.&lt;br&gt;
It’s for cases where &lt;strong&gt;downtime, waste, or repeated headaches&lt;/strong&gt; cost more than doing it right once.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tech Coaching</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/coaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/coaching/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="learning-as-part-of-the-service"&gt;Learning as Part of the Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best solution isn’t a repair — it’s learning how to use the system you already have.&lt;br&gt;
This is especially true with Linux conversions, but it can apply to many other situations in homes and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-coaching-covers"&gt;What Coaching Covers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting comfortable after a Linux install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing email and files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using office software effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up printers, networks, and smart devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General “how to” sessions for everyday tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="practical-and-affordable"&gt;Practical and Affordable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaching costs less than repair or project work.&lt;br&gt;
The goal is confidence: giving you the skills to handle your own system day to day.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Web Design &amp; Website Repair</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/web-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/services/web-design/</guid><description>Simple, durable websites and troubleshooting for sites that have aged or broken down.</description></item><item><title>Building an Offline Tech Toolkit for Rural Missouri</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/offline-tech-toolkit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/offline-tech-toolkit/</guid><description>When the grid and cloud go silent, here’s a comprehensive toolkit of power, comms, and gear that will still work in rural Missouri.</description></item><item><title>Full Privacy Real Simple The Tools of the Modern Ghost</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-guide-to-internet-privacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-guide-to-internet-privacy/</guid><description>Complete practical and understandable.

&lt;p&gt;Every month, businesses and people in Kirksville quietly pay rent on their computers.&lt;br&gt;
A few bucks here for Microsoft 365, a little more for Adobe or some &amp;ldquo;cloud subscription.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
It does not sound bad &amp;ndash; until you realize you have been paying for years&amp;hellip; and the computer is still not yours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="i-am-kirksvilles-linux-guy"&gt;I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer’s slowing down, freezing, or begging for upgrades, it might not be your hardware’s fault — it’s the software.&lt;br&gt;
I help people around Kirksville keep their technology useful with &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, the open-source operating system that quietly runs most of the world’s technology.&lt;br&gt;
This isn’t a sales pitch; it’s just what I do here in town.&lt;/p&gt;

The 'Virus' That Wasn't</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I helped a Kirksville user who swore their system was under attack.&lt;br&gt;
Three red-shield pop-ups screamed &lt;em&gt;“System is infected!”&lt;/em&gt; — all pointing to a domain like &lt;code&gt;d3n7oed9x5adbcxsyz [dot] ows-adsguard [dot] pro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Looks official, right? Except the domain name sounded like a cat ran across the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some quick sleuthing, it turned out not to be a virus at all — but a &lt;strong&gt;browser notification scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along the line, this website had convinced the user to &lt;em&gt;“allow notifications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s all it takes: one click of misplaced trust, and suddenly Firefox is allowed to throw fake security alerts straight to your desktop — even when you’re not browsing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>25 Weird and Wonderful GPU Facts</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/gpu-facts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/gpu-facts/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="25-weird-and-wonderful-gpu-facts"&gt;25 Weird and Wonderful GPU Facts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your laptop or desktop is running &lt;strong&gt;Windows 7, 8, or even early Windows 10 builds&lt;/strong&gt;, you might have noticed a quiet truth: &lt;strong&gt;security updates have stopped&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on an unsupported Windows PC can be frustrating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop-ups warning about end-of-support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications that stop updating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of malware and exploits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining it yourself means &lt;strong&gt;tracking CVEs and patches manually&lt;/strong&gt; — essentially, keeping a full-time security hobby.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="about-switchboard-tech-services"&gt;About Switchboard Tech Services&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;Coaching &amp;amp; Tutoring&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;$20 / hour&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Light Miscellaneous Labor&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;$20 / hour&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Heavy Miscellaneous Labor&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;$35 / hour&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-it-works"&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hourly, not hidden fees&lt;/strong&gt; — I charge for time on the job, not surprise add-ons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family effort&lt;/strong&gt; — We are a team, and members of Switchboard Tech Services, LLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech focus first&lt;/strong&gt; — Most of my work is technical service and support. Non-technical labor is offered only when it makes sense and our schedule allows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No fix, no charge&lt;/strong&gt; — If something can’t be repaired, I’ll say so and you don’t pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-this-matters"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general service, I’ve kept pricing simple so you can budget with confidence.&lt;br&gt;
Whether it’s troubleshooting computers, teaching a system, or pitching in with local labor when help is short, the goal is practical support at clear rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Switchboard Tech Services, Kirksville</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/qr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/qr/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="thanks-for-scanning"&gt;Thanks for Scanning&lt;/h1&gt;

These groups tend to call me most often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landlords&lt;/strong&gt; — quick fixes for tenant gear, laundry boards, Wi-Fi, and appliances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shops &amp;amp; cafés&lt;/strong&gt; — card readers, printers, POS tablets, Wi-Fi networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retirees&lt;/strong&gt; — patient help with phones, email, streaming, and everyday tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students (Truman &amp;amp; ATSU)&lt;/strong&gt; — slow laptops, broken Wi-Fi, Linux installs, tutoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Churches &amp;amp; offices&lt;/strong&gt; — projectors, sound systems, shared printers, backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus is &lt;strong&gt;close to the courthouse square&lt;/strong&gt; — generally within a two-mile walk.&lt;br&gt;
That keeps service responsive and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
