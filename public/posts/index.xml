&lt;h2 id="why-pay-rent-on-software-you-already-own"&gt;Why Pay Rent on Software You Already Own?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every month, businesses and people in Kirksville quietly pay rent on their computers.&lt;br&gt;
A few bucks here for Microsoft 365, a little more for Adobe or some &amp;ldquo;cloud subscription.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
It does not sound bad &amp;ndash; until you realize you have been paying for years&amp;hellip; and the computer is still not yours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="i-am-kirksvilles-linux-guy"&gt;I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer’s slowing down, freezing, or begging for upgrades, it might not be your hardware’s fault — it’s the software.&lt;br&gt;
I help people around Kirksville keep their technology useful with &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, the open-source operating system that quietly runs most of the world’s technology.&lt;br&gt;
This isn’t a sales pitch; it’s just what I do here in town.&lt;/p&gt;

The 'Virus' That Wasn't</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I helped a Kirksville user who swore their system was under attack.&lt;br&gt;
Three red-shield pop-ups screamed &lt;em&gt;“System is infected!”&lt;/em&gt; — all pointing to a domain like &lt;code&gt;d3n7oed9x5adbcxsyz [dot] ows-adsguard [dot] pro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Looks official, right? Except the domain name sounded like a cat ran across the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some quick sleuthing, it turned out not to be a virus at all — but a &lt;strong&gt;browser notification scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along the line, this website had convinced the user to &lt;em&gt;“allow notifications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s all it takes: one click of misplaced trust, and suddenly Firefox is allowed to throw fake security alerts straight to your desktop — even when you’re not browsing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>25 Weird and Wonderful GPU Facts</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/gpu-facts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/gpu-facts/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="25-weird-and-wonderful-gpu-facts"&gt;25 Weird and Wonderful GPU Facts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPUs: those little rectangles in your PC that quietly do most of the heavy lifting. Most people think “graphics card = gaming,” but these silicon beasts have some truly wild stories to tell. Here’s a mix of amazing, strange, and just plain funny GPU facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs can outperform entire supercomputers from the 1990s. That old machine that mapped the human genome? Your gaming card could crush it for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kirksville Computer Repair: Top Problems with 10+ Year Old PCs</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-computer-repair-tips/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-computer-repair-tips/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="kirksville-computer-repair-common-problems-with-10-year-old-pcs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirksville Computer Repair&lt;/strong&gt;: Common Problems with 10+ Year Old PCs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer has seen &lt;strong&gt;10 years of life&lt;/strong&gt;—maybe since Truman was still a joke on reruns—you’re not alone in Kirksville. Old PCs have their quirks, and if you’ve ever stared at a spinning hourglass for longer than a local winter night, this article is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what residents often encounter, and how a reliable &lt;strong&gt;computer service&lt;/strong&gt; can save the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Router Interference: Why Your Wi-Fi Drops Out in Apartment Complexes</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/router-interference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/router-interference/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you live in &lt;strong&gt;Kirksville&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ve probably noticed your Wi-Fi acting weird at certain times — Netflix buffers, calls glitch, smart plugs vanish like they’ve entered the Twilight Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine times out of ten, it’s &lt;strong&gt;not your router dying&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-causing-it"&gt;What’s Causing It?&lt;/h2&gt;</description></item><item><title>Saving Your Old Windows PC: How Linux Can Keep It Secure</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/save-your-old-pc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/save-your-old-pc/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="your-old-windows-pc-isnt-getting-updates--why-thats-a-problem"&gt;Your Old Windows PC Isn’t Getting Updates — Why That’s a Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your laptop or desktop is running &lt;strong&gt;Windows 7, 8, or even early Windows 10 builds&lt;/strong&gt;, you might have noticed a quiet truth: &lt;strong&gt;security updates have stopped&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on an unsupported Windows PC can be frustrating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop-ups warning about end-of-support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications that stop updating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of malware and exploits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining it yourself means &lt;strong&gt;tracking CVEs and patches manually&lt;/strong&gt; — essentially, keeping a full-time security hobby.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
