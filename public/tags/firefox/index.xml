The 'Virus' That Wasn't</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I helped a Kirksville user who swore their system was under attack.&lt;br&gt;
Three red-shield pop-ups screamed &lt;em&gt;“System is infected!”&lt;/em&gt; — all pointing to a domain like &lt;code&gt;d3n7oed9x5adbcxsyz [dot] ows-adsguard [dot] pro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Looks official, right? Except the domain name sounded like a cat ran across the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some quick sleuthing, it turned out not to be a virus at all — but a &lt;strong&gt;browser notification scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along the line, this website had convinced the user to &lt;em&gt;“allow notifications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s all it takes: one click of misplaced trust, and suddenly Firefox is allowed to throw fake security alerts straight to your desktop — even when you’re not browsing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
