&lt;p&gt;Every month, businesses and people in Kirksville quietly pay rent on their computers.&lt;br&gt;
A few bucks here for Microsoft 365, a little more for Adobe or some &amp;ldquo;cloud subscription.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
It does not sound bad &amp;ndash; until you realize you have been paying for years&amp;hellip; and the computer is still not yours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-mo-linux-guy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="i-am-kirksvilles-linux-guy"&gt;I Am Kirksville’s Linux Guy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer’s slowing down, freezing, or begging for upgrades, it might not be your hardware’s fault — it’s the software.&lt;br&gt;
I help people around Kirksville keep their technology useful with &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, the open-source operating system that quietly runs most of the world’s technology.&lt;br&gt;
This isn’t a sales pitch; it’s just what I do here in town.&lt;/p&gt;

The 'Virus' That Wasn't</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/browser-push-notification-scam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I helped a Kirksville user who swore their system was under attack.&lt;br&gt;
Three red-shield pop-ups screamed &lt;em&gt;“System is infected!”&lt;/em&gt; — all pointing to a domain like &lt;code&gt;d3n7oed9x5adbcxsyz [dot] ows-adsguard [dot] pro&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Looks official, right? Except the domain name sounded like a cat ran across the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some quick sleuthing, it turned out not to be a virus at all — but a &lt;strong&gt;browser notification scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along the line, this website had convinced the user to &lt;em&gt;“allow notifications.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s all it takes: one click of misplaced trust, and suddenly Firefox is allowed to throw fake security alerts straight to your desktop — even when you’re not browsing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kirksville Computer Repair: Top Problems with 10+ Year Old PCs</title><link>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-computer-repair-tips/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchboardtechservices.com/posts/kirksville-computer-repair-tips/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="kirksville-computer-repair-common-problems-with-10-year-old-pcs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirksville Computer Repair&lt;/strong&gt;: Common Problems with 10+ Year Old PCs&lt;/h1&gt;
